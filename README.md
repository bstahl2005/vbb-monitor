# VBB-Monitor

A public transport monitor for several display positions on the campus of TH Wildau. It shows departures for S Wildau and Bhf. KÃ¶nigs Wusterhausen.
Initially it was intended to show/place this on a display in the canteen/library building.

This project is a result of the first hackathon of the course of studies "Telematics" at TH Wildau. The hackathon took place at the weekend of 24th and 25th of February 2018.

## TODO

* Add screenshot
* Make some code cleanup and refactoring for the "hacky" parts
* Get this running on a Raspberry Pi

> An electron-vue project
